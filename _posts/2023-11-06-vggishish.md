# VGGIshIsh

I have just released a new project! It is and VGG16 based audio classifier. This particular project is inteded to classify between scratch and hit sounds which are extracted from the *Greatest Hit* [^1] dataset by Andrew Owens et. al.

This VGGIshIsh follows the idea introduced by Vladimir Iashin and Esa Rahtu in their publication *Taming Visually Guided Sound Generation* [^2]. See the GitHub repository of the project for more detailed information and instrucrtions on how to use it ðŸ¤©. Find the project [here](https://github.com/ilpoviertola/vggishish).
